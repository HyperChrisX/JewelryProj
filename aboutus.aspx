            My name is Nhia Yang. I'm a Student at Dunwoody College of Technology and I'll be graduating in the spring of 2016. I decided to create a website
            like this because... It just came into mind. I'm from originally Minnesota, but I moved around. I lived here for my childhood then moved to 
            Kansas for a few years. Then I moved to Michigan during partially of my fifth grade. During my middle school I moved back here and here I am. 
            I had a great adventure. I was about to go into networking, but I notice that I didn't like it anymore because I was about to be force into
            a job that I didn't like. I transfered over to this program... Now I love it. I would like to mention that when I was little I already knew
            what I wanted to be. Well, this program help me get into what I want to be and that is... to be a game creator. So yeah!!!!!
